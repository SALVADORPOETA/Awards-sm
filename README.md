# Awards

Awards is a **high-end animated landing page** built with **React, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP**, focused on immersive motion, interactive UI components, and modern frontend architecture.

This project was developed by following a **tutorial from the YouTube channel *JavaScript Mastery***, which itself was created using the **visual design and inspiration of the Zentry website**.
The purpose of this project is **educational and portfolio-oriented**, showcasing advanced frontend techniques used in modern, animation-heavy web experiences.
