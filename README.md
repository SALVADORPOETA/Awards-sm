This project is based on a YouTube tutorial by JavaScript Mastery. It was built with Vite.js, React.js, TailwindCSS, and GSAP, inspired by the award-winning "Site of the Month" Zentry website. Created while following a tutorial from JavaScript Mastery, it features a floating navbar with animated music controls, allowing users to start music playback with a click. The hero section showcases a full-screen video background with smooth transitions that switch to the next video. The About section includes animated text and image transitions triggered by scrolling, creating a visually engaging experience. Below that, a trendy Bento grid design with a card tilt effect reacts dynamically to cursor movement, adding interactivity.

Another section highlights animated text and images in unique shapes, complete with stylish hover effects. The project concludes with a compelling call-to-action section that features images in various shapes, followed by a minimalist footer. This project serves as both a practice piece and a creative showcase of modern web design techniques, blending cutting-edge frameworks with interactive animations.
