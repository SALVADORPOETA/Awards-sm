This project is built with Vite.js, React.js, and TailwindCSS, inspired by the award-winning "Site of the Month" zentry website. It features an animated floating navbar with music controls, allowing users to click and start the music. The hero section displays a full-screen video with smooth transitions that switch to the next video. The About section includes animated text and image transitions that occur as you scroll. Below that, there's a trendy Bento grid design with a card tilt effect that responds to cursor movement. Another section showcases animated text and images in unique shapes, complete with a stylish hover effect. The project concludes with a compelling call-to-action section, featuring images in various shapes, and a minimalist footer.
